# Resident Denunciation Project

## Overview

This repository contains the codebook, code, and statistical analysis for Dr. Nicholas Barnes's Resident Denunciation Project, a research study examining crime reporting patterns in urban communities.

## Data

The data analysed in this project is sourced from a crime watch hotline located in MarÃ©, a neighbourhood and favela in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22.8518Â° S, 43.2431Â° W). 

**Data Availability:** The dataset will be anonymised and made publicly available shortly before or after publication. Due to the sensitive nature of crime reporting data, we are currently implementing best practices for anonymisation that maintain research utility while ensuring participant confidentiality.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Code book:** Clarifying what variables referenced mean

## Ethical Considerations

This research handles sensitive crime reporting data with careful attention to privacy and anonymisation standards. All data processing follows institutional ethical guidelines for research involving community safety information.
