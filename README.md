## Data ## 
The data analyzed in this project is sourced from a crime watch hotline located in Maré, a neighbourhood and favela in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22.8518° S, 43.2431° W).

**Data Availability:** The dataset will be anonymised and made publicly available shortly before or after publication. Due to the sensitive nature of crime reporting data, we are currently implementing best practices for anonymisation that maintain research utility while ensuring participant confidentiality.

## Repository Contents ##

This repository includes:
* **Code book:** Clarifying what variables referenced mean
* **Data preprocessing:** Cleaning and partitioning the crime hotline data
* **Statistical analysis:** Performing structural break tests to measure data stability over time
